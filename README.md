## Introduction

The Day Planner is a web-based application that allows you to plan your workday hour by hour. It provides a clean and intuitive interface to schedule tasks and events for different hours of the day. The application also dynamically updates the styling of time blocks based on the current time, helping you manage your tasks effectively.

## Features

- **Hourly Time Blocks:** The scheduler provides time blocks for all 24 hours of the day, allowing you to schedule tasks at any time.

- **Dynamic Styling:** Time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future based on the current time.

- **Local Storage:** Your scheduled events are saved in your browser's local storage, so you can access them even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

- **Easy to Use:** The user-friendly interface makes it simple to add, edit, and remove events for each hour of the day.
